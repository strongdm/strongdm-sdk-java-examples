# StrongDM Java SDK Examples

This is the examples repository for the [StrongDM Java SDK](https://github.com/strongdm/strongdm-sdk-java).

> **NOTE:**
> The Advanced Insights reporting and auditing bundle extends the auditing capabilities of the StrongDM API by adding the ability to view the history of what happened in your organization with timestamps and full snapshots. In addition, you can see shells for all replays, view SSH session data as it comes in, watch sessions play live, view queries as they come in, and more. To use these features, Advanced Insights must be enabled for your organization.
>
> To increase flexibility when managing a large volume of Resources, Role Grants have been deprecated in favor of Access Rules, which allow you to grant access based on Resource Tags and Type.
>
> Previously, you would grant a Role access to specific resources by ID via Role Grants. Now, when using Access Rules, the best practice is to give Roles access to Resources based on  type and tags.
>
>The following examples demonstrate Dynamic Access Rules with tags and resource types, as well as Static Access Rules. If it is _necessary_ to grant access to specific Resources in the same way as Role Grants did, you can use Resource IDs directly in Access Rules.
